            <p>We welcomed Peanut into our lives when he was just 12 weeks old. He had our hearts captured the moment we laid eyes on him. Fluffy and timid, he fell asleep during Saturday brunch.</p>

            <p>The dogs at the daycare gave Peanut a very warm welcome to the pack, but he was a bit intimidated by their sizes. He ended up having a blast and didn't want to come home!</p>

            <p>It was Peanut's first official field trip. He had fun running around sniffing apples and biting flowers. Peanut's smile was a rare moment to be captured on camera!</p>
