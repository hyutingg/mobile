        <h2>About Aussiedoodles</h2>
        <p>Mini Aussiedoodles can grow up to 25 pounds. Their common characteristics include affectionate, loyal, and extremely 
          intelligent. Because they are a very energetic breed, they require at least 40 to 60 minutes a day of exercising or
        stimulating games. Their coat is hypoallergenic, which is great for dog-lovers that have allergies. More info about 
      Aussiedoodles can be found <a class="web-link" href="https://www.petlandflorida.com/mini-aussiedoodle-a-puppy-youll-forever-love/" target="_blank">

        <h2>A Day in Life of Peanut</h2>
        <p>Peanut loves to start his day with many cuddles and belly rubs. He then begins his busy day of chasing stuffed bones, 
          zooming around the apartment, and stealing slippers. Peanut's favorite time of the day is when he gets to see his
        girlfriend, Winnie. He loves wrestling and running around the backyard. When the sun slowly sets, Peanut acts as a therapy
      dog to Mom and her roommates, offering cute yawns and special smooches to help relieve their stress.</p>
